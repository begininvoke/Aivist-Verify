# Real-Target Result Matrix

Live measurement of the Aivist Verify engine against third-party public vulnerable targets.
Every verdict below is recorded verbatim, including [REFUTED], [NOT DATA], false positives,
and misses. **The engine was not tuned to make any target pass.** Runs use the
non-interactive `aivist run --config` path (env tokens → structured
JSON); the `tier` field maps to the human verdict badge: `confirmed`→`[CONFIRMED]`,
`refuted`→`[REFUTED]`, `notdata`→`[NOT DATA]`, and `broken_for_all`→`[INCONCLUSIVE]` (the renderer
prints the badge as `[INCONCLUSIVE]  <shape> - <METHOD> <path>`; the broken-for-all framing and the
"human review" wording appear in the body lines beneath it, not in the badge itself). Below, the
shorthand "[INCONCLUSIVE broken-for-all]" is a DESCRIPTION of that tier, never a quote of CLI output.

### What the archived files next to this doc do and do not contain

The ten `*.txt` files beside this document are the **captured stdout/stderr of
`aivist run --config`** — i.e. the engine's structured JSON result. Read them and you can
check, for every run: the baseline and attack **requests** (method, URL, headers, body), the
**responses** (status code, content length, body), the owner-view and bystander probe
results, every deterministic anchor (`caller_identity`, `payload_causality`, `state_jump`,
`negative_assertion`, `owner_view_corroborated`), the `guard_override` channel, the final
`verdict` and `tier`, and the process exit code. That is the HTTP evidence and the code
gate's decision, and it is fully checkable.

**They contain no model output and no model identifier.** Grep them for `ai_verdict_raw`,
`reasoning`, `gemini`, `model`, `prompt` or `llm` and you get zero hits in all ten files —
the `aivist run --config` renderer emits `verdict`/`tier`, so even the raw-vs-final split
that the lab benchmark reports is not present here.

**Model attribution — and the basis for it.** These runs were made with
`gemini-2.5-pro`. That attribution rests on **the operator's own record of how the runs were
configured, not on anything in the committed captures.** You cannot verify it from the files
in this directory, and we would rather say so than let the line read as though you could.
The lab benchmark is different and *is* checkable: every row of
`scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl` carries an explicit `model` field.

Run dates: 2026-08-12 (UTC) — VAmPI + crAPI community/orders in the first session, crAPI
`mechanic_report` in a second session the same day (see the session note under TARGET 2).

## TARGET 1 — VAmPI

- **Image:** `erev0s/vampi:latest` @ `sha256:0a5a224b6e14ae7da6a6ea265178ff71286ff903aec74adee98f660bb0e4ca12`
- **Setup:** `GET /createdb` → seeded users `name1/pass1`, `name2/pass2`, `admin/pass1`; I registered `name3/pass3` (bystander). Created two books with a genuine owner→resource relationship:
  - `attacker_book_a1` — owner **name1**, secret `ATTACKER-SECRET-a1`
  - `victim_book_b2` — owner **name2**, secret `VICTIM-SECRET-b2-ownedbyname2`
- **Manual BOLA confirmation (ground truth):** `name1` (attacker) `GET /books/v1/victim_book_b2` → HTTP 200 `{"book_title":"victim_book_b2","owner":"name2","secret":"VICTIM-SECRET-b2-ownedbyname2"}` — the attacker reads the victim's book + secret. **The endpoint has no ownership check at all: every authenticated user can read every book (broken-for-all).** An anonymous request is 401.

### Results

| Endpoint | Config | What it should be (ground truth + source) | Verdict recorded | Correct? | Raw file |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /books/v1/{book_title}` | attacker+owner, **no bystander** | REAL BOLA — books are owner-private (secret); VAmPI docs list **BOLA** here (erev0s/VAmPI README "Vulnerabilities" → *Broken Object Level Authorization*) | **[CONFIRMED]** `verified` (`owner_view_corroborated=true`, `guard_override=null`) | **True positive** — attacker really read the victim's private book across accounts | `vampi_books-bola_no-bystander_20260812_153710.txt` |
| `GET /books/v1/{book_title}` | attacker+owner+**bystander** | same BOLA — but the endpoint is broken-for-all | **[REFUTED]** `inconclusive` (`guard_override=public_resource_read_not_cross_user`) | **Miss (by design)** — the bystander (name3) can also read it, so the D30 gate treats it as public/shared and declines to confirm | `vampi_books-bola_with-bystander_20260812_153618.txt` |
| `GET /books/v1/{book_title}` | attacker+owner+bystander **+`assert_owner_only`** | same BOLA — operator asserts the resource should be owner-private | **[INCONCLUSIVE broken-for-all]** (`guard_override=broken_for_all_owner_assertion_human_review`, `broken_for_all_suspected=true`) | **Correct handling** — engine logged: *"every AUTHENTICATED principal read this resource, but an anonymous request did NOT (401) … LOCKED inconclusive; surfaced as a CONDITIONAL finding for HUMAN REVIEW (never confirmed)"* | `vampi_books-bola_assert-owner-only_20260812_153756.txt` |
| `GET /users/v1/{username}` | attacker+owner+bystander | **NOT a cross-user BOLA** — endpoint is **public / no-auth** (returns `{username,email}` with no token, HTTP 200). It is an *unauthenticated data-exposure* (out of this tool's BOLA scope). | **[REFUTED]** `inconclusive` (`guard_override=public_resource_read_not_cross_user`) | **Correct (true negative)** — the tool does not mislabel a public endpoint as a cross-user BOLA | `vampi_users-getuser_20260812_153932.txt` |

### VAmPI takeaways (honest)

- **The `/books` BOLA is real but broken-for-all.** The engine's verdict is config-dependent: it **CONFIRMS** with two accounts, **REFUTES as public** the moment a bystander is supplied, and surfaces **[broken-for-all / human review]** when the operator asserts owner-privacy.
- **This is a genuine limitation to state plainly:** by default (with a bystander), the D30 public-resource gate **misses** VAmPI's documented `/books` BOLA — because "readable by every authenticated user" is, black-box, indistinguishable from "shared by design." The *correct* way to catch a broken-for-all BOLA with this tool is the owner-only assertion **plus a bystander token** (`--assert-owner-only` on `scan`, or `"assert_owner_only": true` on a `run --config` op) — the assertion on its own is inert, because the disclosure path only runs after the bystander probe has shown that a third identity can read the object. It flags the finding for human review rather than confirming it.
- No run degraded — VAmPI's 60-second JWT expiry did not bite (each verify finished well under 60 s).

---

## TARGET 2 — crAPI

- **Version:** official OWASP crAPI docker-compose, `VERSION=latest`. Pulled digests:
  `crapi-identity@sha256:5d1db5b3…`, `crapi-community@sha256:8ba0c7ed…`, `crapi-workshop@sha256:d4d2d94d…`,
  `crapi-web@sha256:b27d246c…`, `gateway-service@sha256:97dade9d…` (+ mongo:4.4, postgres:14, chroma).
  Gateway on `http://localhost:8888`; mailhog on `:8025`. All core services Healthy.
- **Setup:** signed up + logged in three users `attacker@crapi.io` / `owner@crapi.io` / `bystander@crapi.io`
  (password `Crapi@1234`). crAPI JWTs are long-lived (no expiry issue). Created real resources per endpoint.

> **Session note — `mechanic_report` was measured in a SECOND session, on a FRESH database state.**
> The `mechanic_report` rows below did **not** continue the first session. When that endpoint was
> re-attempted, the crAPI stack had been torn down and brought back up, and the first session's
> `@crapi.io` accounts were **no longer in the database** (the persisted volume held a different set of
> users). Same target, same image digests, same `VERSION=latest` — but a **new** run with **new**
> accounts (`mrAtk…@crapi.io` / `mrOwn…@crapi.io` / `mrBys…@crapi.io`) and new resources. It is
> recorded as a new run, not as a resumed one. The community-post, orders, `/books` and `/users` rows
> are untouched first-session results.

### Results

| Endpoint | Config | What it should be (ground truth + source) | Verdict recorded | Correct? | Raw file |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /community/api/v2/community/posts/{postId}` | attacker+owner+bystander | **PUBLIC community feed** — every user sees every post by design; reading another's post is NOT a violation. (This is the endpoint that produced the **D30 false positive** in the prior session; the D30 fix was only fixture-validated → live re-confirmation was pending.) | **[REFUTED]** `inconclusive` (`guard_override=public_resource_read_not_cross_user`) | **Correct (true negative)** — ✅ **THE PENDING D30 LIVE RE-CONFIRMATION PASSES**: the false positive is fixed on the real target | `crapi_community-post_D30_20260812_154703.txt` |
| `GET /workshop/api/shop/orders/{order_id}` | attacker+owner+bystander | **NOT a cross-user BOLA — fully public / missing auth.** ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-08-12, see the note below.** The endpoint requires **no token at all**: an anonymous request returns the complete owner order (email, phone, `transaction_id`, partial card number). It is an *unauthenticated data exposure*, out of this tool's BOLA scope — the same class as VAmPI `/users`, not the same class as VAmPI `/books`. | **[REFUTED]** `inconclusive` (`guard_override=public_resource_read_not_cross_user`) | **Correct (true negative)** — the tool does not mislabel a public endpoint as a cross-user BOLA | `crapi_shop-orders_20260812_154834.txt` |
| `GET /workshop/api/mechanic/mechanic_report?report_id=` | attacker+owner, **no bystander** | **REAL BOLA** — crAPI docs list BOLA on mechanic_report (**query-string** id). Ground truth re-established by hand before the engine ran: the attacker read the owner's report → HTTP 200 disclosing the owner's email, phone, VIN `7R5XWJ6HCY2FJUR03` and the private work-order text. | **[CONFIRMED]** `verified` (`owner_view_corroborated=true`, `guard_override=null`) | **True positive** — the attacker really read the victim's private work order across accounts | `crapi_mechanic-report_no-bystander_20260812_163905.txt` |
| `GET /workshop/api/mechanic/mechanic_report?report_id=` | attacker+owner+**bystander** | same BOLA — but the endpoint is broken-for-all (the bystander also read the owner's `report_id` → HTTP 200) | **[REFUTED]** `inconclusive` (`guard_override=public_resource_read_not_cross_user`) | **Miss (by design)** — the same D30 tradeoff as VAmPI `/books` and crAPI `/shop/orders` | `crapi_mechanic-report_with-bystander_20260812_163928.txt` |
| `GET /workshop/api/mechanic/mechanic_report?report_id=` | attacker+owner+bystander **+`assert_owner_only`** | same BOLA — operator asserts the work order should be owner-private | **`broken_for_all` tier** — `inconclusive` (`guard_override=broken_for_all_owner_assertion_human_review`, `broken_for_all_suspected=true`) | **Correct handling** — engine logged the anonymous probe as a clean denial (`anon_status=401 reason='non_2xx:401'`) and LOCKED the verdict inconclusive for human review; never confirmed | `crapi_mechanic-report_assert-owner-only_20260812_163948.txt` |

**mechanic_report — measured, and what it took (honest).** The first session recorded this endpoint as
**NOT MEASURED (setup-blocked)**; it has now been run. Both blockers were **target-environment problems,
not engine limits**, and neither required any change to Aivist Verify:

1. **The VIN/pincode source.** The engine's D24 owner-view gate needs the **report owner's** token to
   corroborate a confirm, so the report must belong to a credential-controlled user. That needs crAPI's
   vehicle-claim → `contact_mechanic` flow, which needs a VIN + pincode normally delivered by the signup
   welcome email — and this deployment's mailhog delivered **empty bodies**. **Worked around by reading
   the pincode directly out of crAPI's own `vehicle_details` table** (unclaimed vehicles sit in a pool
   with their pincodes in plaintext), then claiming the vehicle through the **real `add_vehicle` API**
   exactly as a user would. **This is target-environment setup, not engine behaviour** — a reproducer
   who gets working welcome emails will not need the database step, and the database was read only to
   obtain a credential crAPI intended to mail to its own user.
2. **`contact_mechanic` requires https.** crAPI's own OpenAPI example gives the callback as
   `mechanic_api: http://localhost:8000/workshop/api/mechanic/receive_report`, but this deployment runs
   with `TLS_ENABLED=true`, so the workshop service serves **HTTPS** on port 8000 and every `http://`
   callback fails with `400 {"message":"Could not connect to mechanic api."}`. Using
   `https://localhost:8000/...` succeeds. This blocker was **not** diagnosed in the first session — even
   with a valid VIN, the earlier attempt would still have failed here.

**Query-string coverage.** `mechanic_report` carries its object id in the **query string**
(`?report_id=`), not in the path. These three runs therefore extend the archive to the query-param id
path (`build_op` → `location: "query_param"`); the earlier VAmPI/crAPI runs all exercised path-segment
ids only.

The first session's manual observation of the seed report (`report_id=1`, owned by `robot001@example.com`)
is kept alongside as `crapi_mechanic-report_MANUAL_setup-blocked_20260812_155237.txt` — the record of the
block, not of a verdict.

> **⚠️ CORRECTION (2026-08-12, second session) — `/shop/orders` was mis-annotated as a BOLA.**
> The first session's row for `GET /workshop/api/shop/orders/{order_id}` described the endpoint as
> "**REAL BOLA** … Auth-required … but broken-for-all." **That ground-truth annotation was wrong.** While
> the crAPI stack was still up for the `mechanic_report` runs, the endpoint was re-probed directly:
> an **anonymous request with no `Authorization` header returns HTTP 200 with the full owner order**
> (verified on two separate order ids). So it is **fully public / missing authentication**, not a
> cross-user BOLA at all, and it is **out of scope** for a BOLA confirmer — the same class as VAmPI
> `/users`. The first session's hand-verification only compared *authenticated* identities and never
> issued an anonymous probe, which is how the mislabel survived.
>
> **What does NOT change:** the engine's recorded verdict, `[REFUTED]` /
> `public_resource_read_not_cross_user`, was and remains **correct** — and is now correct for an even
> more clear-cut reason. The archived capture is untouched.
>
> **What DOES change:** `/shop/orders` must **not** be cited as an example of a real BOLA the tool
> misses. The genuine broken-for-all misses, both with an archived clean **anonymous 401** proving the
> resource is not public, are **VAmPI `/books`** and **crAPI `mechanic_report`**. This also matches what
> [`../../../docs/AUDIT.md`](../../../docs/AUDIT.md) and [`../../../docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../../docs/ROADMAP.md)
> already recorded ("that endpoint is fully public / missing-auth"); this file was the outlier.

## Bottom line (honest)

- **The single most important run passed:** the crAPI **community-post D30 false positive is fixed on the live target** — [REFUTED] as public, not a spurious [CONFIRMED]. The previously fixture-only validation now holds live.
- **The tool produced ZERO false positives across all 9 completed engine runs** (6 in the first session + 3 `mechanic_report` runs in the second) — no public/shared resource was ever confirmed as a cross-user BOLA.
- **The dominant limitation, measured on two real targets:** the D30 public-resource gate **misses genuine broken-for-all BOLAs** — **VAmPI `/books`** (secret disclosure) and **crAPI `mechanic_report`** (email, phone, VIN, private work-order text) are real, serious BOLAs that the tool **[REFUTED]** once a bystander token is supplied, because "readable by every authenticated user" is black-box-indistinguishable from "shared by design." Both are genuinely broken-for-all rather than public: each has an archived **anonymous probe cleanly denied with 401**. The way to surface these is the owner-only assertion — `--assert-owner-only` on `scan`, or `"assert_owner_only": true` on a `run --config` op — **together with a bystander token** (the assertion alone is inert: the disclosure path only runs after the bystander probe has established that a third identity can read the object). It then reports them as the `broken_for_all` tier — inconclusive, flagged for human review — rather than confirming them. Demonstrated live on **both** targets. (crAPI `/shop/orders` is **not** an example of this limitation — it is public / missing-auth, see the correction above.)
- **Clean cross-user BOLA (attacker+owner, no bystander): confirmed on BOTH targets** — VAmPI `/books` and crAPI `mechanic_report`, each **[CONFIRMED]** `verified` through the D24 owner-view channel. Neither endpoint is a *private-by-design* resource: both are **broken-for-all**, so on both targets the verdict is **config-dependent in exactly the same way** — `verified` with two accounts, `[REFUTED]` as public the moment a bystander is supplied, and `broken_for_all` / human review when the operator asserts owner-privacy. crAPI's remaining endpoints are both correctly refuted for the same reason — they are not cross-user resources at all (community post = public by design; `/shop/orders` = public / missing auth).
- **No engine tuning, no retries-until-green.** Every verdict is the first/only run, archived verbatim.

---

## Known BOLAs NOT covered this session

- **crAPI GraphQL / multi-step BOLAs** (e.g. the coupon/GraphQL flows) — the engine confirms a
  single REST operation with a path/query id swap; GraphQL and multi-request business flows are
  out of scope for this run.
- **VAmPI write-side issues** — mass-assignment on register (`admin:true`), `PUT /users/v1/{username}/email|password`,
  unauthenticated `GET /users/v1/_debug` (all-passwords dump), and JWT weaknesses — not object-read
  BOLAs, not probed here.
