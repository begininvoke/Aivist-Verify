# LLM Providers — bring your own model / gateway

The AI calls (the deep verifier, and scan's candidate proposal) go through a small provider seam
(`backend/app/services/llm/`) so you can point the engine at any backend. **Default is
Gemini, and with every `LLM_*` unset the behavior is byte-identical to before this seam
existed.**

> **Connectivity, NOT correctness.** The seam guarantees you can connect and get a
> completion back. The **zero-false-positive evidence is measured on `gemini-2.5-pro`
> only** and does **not** transfer to any other model. A non-Gemini backend gets provider
> freedom, not a correctness / zero-FP guarantee.

## Configuration (`backend/.env` or environment)

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `gemini` (default) · `openai` · `anthropic` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | key for the selected provider (gemini falls back to `GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint (relay/gateway/local); used by `openai`, ignored by `gemini` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | model id (gemini falls back to `GEMINI_PRO_MODEL`) |

Unset everything ⇒ Gemini via `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_PRO_MODEL`.

## The three backends

### 1. Gemini (default)
The `google-genai` SDK (already a dependency). Uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_PRO_MODEL`
unless overridden by `LLM_API_KEY` / `LLM_MODEL`. This is the byte-identical path.

**Which model, and what the evidence covers.** `GEMINI_PRO_MODEL` defaults to
`gemini-2.5-pro`. That default is deliberate: `gemini-2.5-pro` is the **only** model the
zero-false-positive evidence was measured on — every row of the committed artifact
`scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl` carries `model: "gemini-2.5-pro"`. A first-run
user therefore lands on the configuration the numbers in `RESULTS.md` describe.

**`gemini-2.5-pro` is the more expensive model.** That cost is the price of the default
matching the evidence, and we would rather you pay it knowingly than be quietly moved to a
cheaper model our numbers do not cover. Every other model — `gemini-2.5-flash` included —
remains fully selectable:

```bash
GEMINI_PRO_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash     # cheaper; NOT the measured configuration
# or, provider-neutral:
LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

What you give up by switching is stated plainly: **connectivity, not a zero-FP guarantee.**
The seam guarantees the call works and a completion comes back. It does not re-validate the
zero-false-positive claim on any other model — not another Gemini tier, not another vendor.
If you run on something else, the engine's deterministic gates still run in full (they read
HTTP evidence, never the model's text), but the measured false-positive rate is no longer a
statement about your configuration.

### 2. OpenAI-compatible (`LLM_PROVIDER=openai`)
**ONE** implementation covers the whole compatible ecosystem via `LLM_BASE_URL`: OpenAI
itself, relays, DeepSeek, Kimi/Moonshot, GLM/Zhipu, Qwen, Grok/xAI, and local
servers (Ollama / vLLM at `/v1`). Requires `pip install openai`.

```bash
# A relay / gateway
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_BASE_URL=https://your-relay.example/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# DeepSeek
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat

# Local Ollama (any placeholder key works)
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1
```

### 3. Anthropic / Claude (`LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`)
The Claude Messages API. Requires `pip install anthropic`.

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
LLM_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
```

## Notes
- **Optional SDKs.** `openai` / `anthropic` are **not** in `requirements.txt`. Install the
  ones you need with `pip install -r backend/requirements-llm.txt` (or individually); the
  provider raises a clear `pip install X` error (`LLMConfigError`) if the SDK is missing.
- **JSON mode.** Gemini and OpenAI enforce JSON at the API layer
  (`response_mime_type` / `response_format`); Claude has no strict flag, so JSON relies on
  the system prompt (best-effort).
- **Failure is graceful.** A provider error degrades to an `inconclusive` / degraded
  verdict (deep verifier) — it never crashes a batch.
- **Design.** `services/llm/` = the `LLMProvider` protocol + `get_provider()` factory +
  `gemini.py` / `openai_compat.py` / `anthropic.py`. Only the model *call* sits behind it;
  the verdict logic (the four channels, the cross-resource guard, every anchor, the D24
  owner-view gate, and the D19 promotion path) is untouched. The Gemini path is proven
  byte-identical by `test_llm_provider.py`'s request-capture anchor.
