Most access-control tools hand you a pile of *maybe* — suspected IDORs you still have to verify by hand, at 2 a.m., one by one. **Aivist Verify hands you proof, or an honest "no."** You give it a candidate — one endpoint, two identities — and it tells you whether the attacker actually crosses a user boundary into the victim's resource, with a reproducible evidence chain attached.

The part that matters: **the verdict is decided by code, not the model.** The AI reads the traffic and *proposes*; a deterministic, downgrade-only gate *disposes*. On a 430-run benchmark, the model's raw output asked to mark a **secure** endpoint `verified` **79 times** — and the code gate refused **every single one of them**. Zero false positives. Not "fewer." Zero — by construction, on a benchmark you can re-run yourself in one command. Then we took it to two public vulnerable targets we didn't write — crAPI and VAmPI — and it confirmed two real cross-user BOLAs there without a single false positive.

## Why this exists

Two kinds of tools already sit around this problem, and both leave the same gap:

- **Open-source scanners** are good at surfacing *maybe*. They flag suspected IDORs and — often in their own README — hand the actual confirmation back to you.
- **Closed SaaS validators** do run exploitability checks, but the logic is a black box, the finding is a report you can't independently reproduce, and "fewer false positives" is a statistical hope, not a structural guarantee.

Aivist Verify is the layer between them: **open-source, local, and structurally incapable of emitting a false `verified`** — with an evidence chain any reviewer can replay. It didn't start here. It started as a full AI penetration-testing *platform* — a server, an API, a dashboard. Somewhere in the build it became obvious that the world doesn't need another thing that surfaces *maybe*; it needs something that *confirms*. So the entire server layer got deleted, and everything collapsed onto the one part with real value: the confirmation engine. What's left is small on purpose.

## How it works — AI proposes, code disposes

```
 candidate (endpoint + attacker/owner identities)
        │
        ▼
 [ AI proposes ]   the model reads the real baseline/attack traffic and proposes a candidate
        │          verdict; it may request ONE extra evidence fetch, executed for real.
        ▼
 [ CODE disposes ] deterministic gates re-check the proposal against the attack's own runtime
        │          bytes. They can only DOWNGRADE. A `verified` survives only if a structural
        │          exemption, computed in code, actually holds. The model's opinion is not an input.
        ▼
 verdict + evidence chain   (the model's RAW verdict AND the gate's decision, recorded separately)
```

This is not "AI is useless, code does the real work." It's the opposite: **you need both, and most tools get the split wrong.** Only the model can read messy, business-specific traffic and pick out which of a thousand endpoints is *worth checking* — code can't guess that. And only code can then rule on whether the access *actually* crossed a user boundary — because a model, left to decide, will state a false positive with total confidence. The model is the prospector that smells where the gold might be; the code is the assay that never mistakes pyrite for gold. Aivist Verify puts each where it belongs: **the AI has range, the code has the final word, and the final word can only ever be to take a claim away** — never to invent one. That is why a model can't talk it into a false positive.

Every result records the model's **raw** verdict (`ai_verdict_raw`) *and* the gate's decision (`guard_override`) as **separate fields**, so the evidence chain literally reads "the model proposed X; code decided Y." Neither the engine nor the CLI can manufacture a `verified`.

## See it — a real confirmation, unedited

`aivist demo` boots a built-in vulnerable lab and confirms a real cross-user write end to end — no Docker, no target, no tokens. This is the actual, unmodified render:

```text
[CONFIRMED]  cross-user write (BOLA) - POST /api/users/1/display-name
  Verdict: verified  (confirming channel: write-record read-back)  (guard_override=write_record_readback_decisive)
  Basis: a deterministic code gate authorized this (write-then-independent-read proof), not the model's opinion alone.
  What the engine proved:
    Wrote as the attacker, then read the object back through a different
    endpoint as another identity. A record carrying the victim's object id and
    the exact value this attack wrote was found on that read-back, so the
    unauthorized write provably persisted. That persisted read-back is the
    proof.
  Here's what happened - the Evidence chain (physical bytes the engine actually exchanged):
    1. Sent as the attacker:
       POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/users/2/display-name
       Content-Type: application/json
       Authorization: ***REDACTED***
       Body: {"display_name": "vm-1-eae9d9d20e"}
    2. Attack response received:
       -> HTTP 200 | Content-Length: 15
       {"status":"ok"}
    3. What decided it (byte-level):
       - the write was attributed to the attacker's own identity  (caller_identity=same_as_caller)
       - this attack's unique value was present in the read-back body - the write landed  (payload_causality=confirmed_in_body)
       - the anchoring read-back path was not found (observe-only)  (anchoring_result=failed_path_not_found)
    4. Not taken as proof:
       - the model's raw opinion alone did NOT decide this - the deterministic code channel did  (ai_verdict_raw=verified)
  Re-runnable evidence package (fill <REDACTED> from YOUR config; never a live token):
    # 1) The attack request - reproduces the cross-user access AS THE ATTACKER:
    curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/users/2/display-name' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: <REDACTED>' \
    --data '{"display_name": "vm-1-eae9d9d20e"}'
  So what / Next step:
    A real cross-user access bug: the attacker could write to the victim's
    object. It is reproducible (the request above).
    Next: report it, or fix by enforcing an ownership check on this endpoint.
  [lab oracle] lab label=REAL (expects verified); engine said 'verified' - AGREES. (informational only; NEVER an input to the verdict)
```

And when the attacker gains nothing, the tool says so: a run with no cross-user effect returns **`[REFUTED]`** ("the code gate held the line — no cross-user effect confirmed"); a run that gets rate-limited or hits an expired token returns **`[NOT DATA]`** and claims **no verdict at all** — neither safe nor vulnerable. It refuses to guess. That refusal is the whole point.

## The proof — 430 runs, zero false positives

Five confirmation shapes — cross-user write, read-type semantic equivalence, silent-write / object-state, delete / negative-assertion, and mass-assignment / low-entropy state-jump — run against **two structurally different, self-contained vulnerable labs** (integer ids and UUID ids), driven by a **real** `gemini-2.5-pro` loop, freshly seeded every run:

| Source: `scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl` | Result |
|---|---|
| SECURE / control runs → final `verified` | **300 → 0** — zero false positives |
| Real-vulnerability runs → final `verified` | **130 → 130** — every planted flaw caught, via its expected channel |
| Usable runs | **430 / 430**, zero degraded |
| Times the model's raw output asked to `verified` a SECURE endpoint — and the gate refused | **79 / 79** |

Read that last row again: on **79** separate runs the AI wanted to confirm a vulnerability that wasn't there, and the code gate stopped all 79 from ever reaching a `verified`. That is the moat, measured.

**This is a controlled benchmark on two labs — not a tally of real-world kills.** Clean real-world confirmations are genuinely rare, and this project's honest headline is *discriminative power plus a zero-false-positive discipline*, not a screen full of `CONFIRMED`. Every number above is recomputed from the committed artifact `scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl` — the canonical one — see [`RESULTS.md`](./RESULTS.md).

A second 430-row artifact, `sweep_highN_d19.jsonl`, is committed as the acceptance record for the D19 promotion layer. It is a *separate measured pass*, and counted the same way its last row is **77**, not 79 — the model's raw opinion on borderline SAFE cases is sampled with no seed and varies between passes. Both passes agree on the claim itself: 300 → 0 and 130 → 130. [`REPRODUCE.md`](./REPRODUCE.md) shows the per-case difference and gives you the command to check either.

## Validated on real, public targets — not just our own labs

The benchmark above runs on labs we built. So we took the engine to **two public, deliberately-vulnerable
targets we did not write** — [crAPI](https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI) and
[VAmPI](https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI) — and ran it against their documented BOLAs. **Nine engine runs,
two real cross-user BOLAs confirmed, zero false positives** — and one genuine false positive found,
fixed, and re-confirmed live. Every run below is archived verbatim in
[`scripts/measure/real_targets/`](./scripts/measure/real_targets/).

| Target | Endpoint | Ground truth | Verdict | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **crAPI** | `GET /workshop/api/mechanic/mechanic_report?report_id=` | real BOLA — leaks the owner's email, phone, VIN and private work-order text | **`verified`** | ✅ **true positive** |
| **VAmPI** | `GET /books/v1/{book_title}` | real BOLA — owner-private book with a secret | **`verified`** | ✅ **true positive** |
| **crAPI** | `GET /community/api/v2/community/posts/{postId}` | public feed — *this endpoint once produced a false positive* | `inconclusive` (public) | ✅ **the fix, re-confirmed live** |
| **crAPI** | `GET /workshop/api/mechanic/mechanic_report?report_id=` (+ bystander) | the same real BOLA, but readable by every authenticated user | `inconclusive` | ⚠️ **missed by design** — see below |
| **crAPI** | `GET /workshop/api/shop/orders/{order_id}` | public / no auth — an anonymous request reads the whole order, so not a cross-user BOLA | `inconclusive` (public) | ✅ true negative |
| **VAmPI** | `GET /users/v1/{username}` | public / no auth — not a cross-user BOLA | `inconclusive` (public) | ✅ true negative |

Both confirmations arrived through the same code-adjudicated channel as the lab runs — the owner-view
gate corroborating that the attacker received the owner's authentic data. The crAPI case also exercises a
**query-string** object id rather than a path parameter.

### The false positive we found in ourselves

On an earlier real-target run, crAPI's **public community feed** was confirmed as a cross-user
violation. It wasn't one — the posts are public by design. That was a real false positive, in the one
place it hurts most: the guarantee this whole tool is built on.

So it was fixed — a public-resource probe that reads the same object as an unrelated third identity, and
suppresses the confirmation when that third party can read it too. The fix was validated on fixtures, and
then **re-run against live crAPI**, where the same endpoint now returns `inconclusive`. That live
re-confirmation is archived with the rest.

We publish this because a tool that has never been wrong in public has usually never been tested in
public. The interesting question is not whether a false positive ever happened — it is what the tool does
the second time.

### What it will miss — and why that is the trade

The same probe that fixed the community-feed false positive causes a deliberate miss. When **every
authenticated user** can read a resource, the engine refuses to confirm it — even when it is a real
vulnerability. Both crAPI's `mechanic_report` (leaking an owner's email, phone, VIN and private
work-order text) and VAmPI's `/books` are exactly that: real BOLAs that flip to `inconclusive` the
moment a bystander token is supplied. In both cases an anonymous request is cleanly refused — the
resources are genuinely broken, not genuinely public — and the engine still declines to confirm.

This is not a bug, and it is not fixable by a better algorithm. Black-box, **"every authenticated user can
read this because authorization is broken" and "every authenticated user can read this by design" produce
byte-identical responses.** The distinguishing fact is the API author's *intent*, and intent is not present
in any HTTP response. OpenAPI `security` metadata cannot decide it either — it declares *authentication*
requirements, not row-level ownership. Guessing from content (e.g. "this contains PII, so it should be
private") would manufacture false positives: a public staff directory legitimately exposes emails.

So the engine takes the trade deliberately: **it would rather miss a real finding than invent one.**

When you *know* a resource is meant to be owner-private, you can supply that intent yourself. With a
bystander token configured, `--assert-owner-only` (on `scan`, or `"assert_owner_only": true` in a
`run --config` op) makes the engine probe anonymously, and if every authenticated identity could read the
object while an anonymous request was cleanly refused, it surfaces the finding as
**`inconclusive` — broken-for-all, flagged for human review.** Even then it never auto-confirms: operator
intent can raise a finding for review, but it can never manufacture a `verified`. Demonstrated live on
both targets.

## Quickstart

Python 3.11+ and a Gemini API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`):

```bash
pip install -e .          # installs the `aivist` command
aivist config             # choose provider, paste your API key (hidden), pick a model
aivist demo               # confirm a real BOLA on the built-in lab — zero setup
```

Then point it at your **own** locally-running target — the shortest path is the interactive console:

```bash
aivist                    # opens the console: demo · config · target · verify · scan
```

…or drive it non-interactively (below).

## Installation & full usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Aivist/Aivist-Verify.git
cd Aivist-Verify
pip install -e .          # registers the `aivist` command; config lives under ~/.aivist/
```

**`aivist verify` — confirm one finding.**

```bash
# LAB mode: confirm against a built-in ground-truth caseset
aivist verify --caseset <caseset.json> [--case <id>]

# EXTERNAL mode: a locally-run real target = base URL + OpenAPI spec + one operation
aivist verify --target http://localhost:8888 --spec ./openapi.json --op ./operation.json
# optional: --auth ./login.json for automatic re-login instead of static tokens
```

**`aivist scan` — non-interactive auto-discovery + confirm.** From an OpenAPI spec *or* spec-less:

```bash
aivist scan --target-file ./mytarget.txt
aivist scan --target-file ./mytarget.txt --endpoints-file ./endpoints.txt   # plain METHOD /path list
aivist scan --target-file ./mytarget.txt --traffic-file   ./capture.har     # browser/Burp HAR or raw-HTTP
aivist scan --target-file ./mytarget.txt --capture                          # live mitmproxy capture
aivist scan --target-file ./mytarget.txt --assert-owner-only                # surface "broken for all" for review
```

**`aivist run --config <json>` — the fully non-interactive entry (CI / scripting).** JSON in, structured JSON to stdout, tokens from the environment only — no prompts. **This is the main path for automated use:**

```bash
aivist run --config ./config.json            # machine-readable JSON on stdout
aivist run --config ./config.json --pretty   # + a human summary on stderr (stdout stays pure JSON)
```

**`aivist target` / `aivist config`** — save a reusable target as one editable file (`--dump-template` / `--from-file`, all-errors-at-once validation); set the AI provider/key/model.

**Tokens** come from the environment (or, for `scan`, a `--tokens-file` read at use-time and never persisted):

```bash
export TARGET_ATTACKER_TOKEN=...    # the attacker (the attack is sent as this account)
export TARGET_OWNER_TOKEN=...       # the victim/owner (re-read only, as the owner)
export TARGET_BYSTANDER_TOKEN=...   # a third account that does NOT own the resource
```

An `attacker == owner` collision is refused fail-closed before the engine runs; tokens are never echoed or logged.

## Reproduce it yourself

You don't have to trust a transcript — the evidence is re-runnable in three independent layers:

```bash
# Layer 1 — the labs' own ground truth, NO API key. The engine is graded against these, never the reverse.
python -m pytest vulnerable_target/test_vulns.py -q      # 31 tests
python -m pytest depot_target/test_vulns.py -q           # 23 tests

# Layer 2 — the committed result artifact, NO API key: one JSON row per run, raw verdict -> final verdict,
# which exemption fired, every anchor, a per-row regression check. Small and diffable.
#   scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl

# Layer 3 — regenerate Layer 2 from Layer 1 with YOUR OWN Gemini key (~430 calls).
python scripts/measure/verdict_measure.py \
  --caseset scripts/measure/casesets/vulnerable_target.json \
  --caseset scripts/measure/casesets/depot.json \
  --n-safe 20 --n-vuln 10 --out scripts/measure/results/sweep_highN.jsonl
```

Full method and the documented **bounds** of each channel: [`REPRODUCE.md`](./REPRODUCE.md) and [`RESULTS.md`](./RESULTS.md).

## ⚠️ Scope & safety

**Read this before pointing it at anything.**

- **Authorized targets only.** Confirming a BOLA/IDOR sends real cross-user requests with real credentials. Only run against systems you own or have **explicit written permission** to test. Unauthorized testing may be illegal.
- **Localhost / self-hosted targets.** Built and tested for locally-run targets you control. It is not a tool for scanning third-party or internet-facing systems, and it is not a mass-scanner.
- **No authentication of its own.** Aivist Verify has no access control around itself — run it locally, never expose it as a service.
- **You supply the credentials.** It only ever acts as the identities whose tokens you provide, against the single target you point it at.

A tool whose entire value is *honesty* has to be honest about its own boundaries. The narrower and clearer the scope, the more the zero-false-positive claim can be trusted.

## Capabilities & honest limits

**Supported (built and audited in-repo):** OpenAPI-spec and spec-less discovery (manual endpoint lists, HAR / raw-HTTP parsing, live mitmproxy capture); static-token *and* automatic re-login auth; a challenge/rate-limit circuit-breaker that aborts to `NOT DATA` rather than hammer a target; three model providers behind one seam (Gemini default, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic); and the fully non-interactive `run --config` entry for CI.

**Limits, stated plainly:** the **statistical** zero-false-positive record comes from **two controlled labs**; the engine has additionally been validated against **two public real targets** (crAPI and VAmPI — nine hand-verified runs, [above](#validated-on-real-public-targets--not-just-our-own-labs)), but it has **not** been run at scale across diverse production systems — "supported" means the capability exists and is audited, not that it's been battle-tested in the wild. The read-semantic confirmation gate has **documented bounds** (see `RESULTS.md`), including a deliberate miss on broken-for-all resources. The tool has **no authentication** and targets **localhost**.
